# Project Improvements Plan

## 1. React Native Upgrade Strategy

### Current State

- React Native version: 0.71.14
- React version: 18.2.0
- Using older architecture with potential iOS pod and boost issues

### Upgrade Path Options

#### Option 1: Incremental Upgrade (Recommended)

1. Upgrade to React Native 0.72.x first

   - This version has better stability and fixes many issues
   - Maintains compatibility with existing codebase
   - Easier migration path

2. Then upgrade to React Native 0.73.x

   - Includes performance improvements
   - Better TypeScript support
   - Improved Hermes engine

3. Finally, consider the New Architecture
   - Requires more significant changes
   - Better performance and stability
   - Future-proof solution

#### Option 2: Direct New Architecture Migration

- More complex and risky
- Requires significant code changes
- Better long-term solution but higher initial effort

### Upgrade Steps

1. Update package.json dependencies
2. Update iOS pods
3. Update Android Gradle configurations
4. Test thoroughly on both platforms
5. Address any breaking changes
6. Update TypeScript configurations

## 2. State Management Improvements

### Current State

- Using local component state
- No global state management solution
- Data fetching handled in components

### Recommended Changes

1. Implement Zustand for state management

   - Lightweight and simple
   - Great TypeScript support
   - Easy to implement and maintain

2. Create stores for:

   - User experiment data
   - Price calculations
   - Cart/Order management
   - User preferences

3. Implement proper data caching
   - Cache API responses
   - Implement offline support
   - Add retry mechanisms

## 3. Code Structure and Architecture

### Current State

- Basic service layer
- Simple data models
- Limited separation of concerns

### Recommended Improvements

1. Implement proper folder structure:

```
app/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── common/
  │   └── features/
  ├── hooks/
  ├── services/
  ├── stores/
  ├── types/
  ├── utils/
  └── screens/
```

2. Add custom hooks:

   - usePriceCalculation
   - useExperiment
   - useBeaconPrice
   - useCart

3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Add loading states and error handling
5. Implement proper navigation structure

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Current State

- Basic Jest setup
- Limited test coverage
- No E2E tests

### Recommended Improvements

1. Unit Tests:

   - Price calculation logic
   - API services
   - Custom hooks
   - Utility functions

2. Integration Tests:

   - Component interactions
   - Navigation flows
   - State management
   - API integration

3. E2E Tests:

   - User flows
   - Critical paths
   - Platform-specific features

4. Testing Tools:
   - Jest for unit tests
   - React Native Testing Library
   - Detox for E2E testing
   - MSW for API mocking

## 5. Feature Enhancements

### Current State

- Basic price calculation
- Simple experiment variant handling
- Limited user feedback

### Recommended Additions

1. Enhanced Price Features:

   - Bulk pricing tiers
   - Seasonal discounts
   - Country-specific promotions
   - Tax calculations

2. User Experience:

   - Order history
   - Saved preferences
   - Price alerts
   - Favorite items

3. Analytics:

   - User behavior tracking
   - Experiment results
   - Price sensitivity analysis
   - Conversion tracking

4. Performance:
   - Image optimization
   - Lazy loading
   - Performance monitoring
   - Memory leak detection

## 6. Security Improvements

1. API Security:

   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add request signing
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request validation

2. Data Security:
   - Secure storage for sensitive data
   - Input sanitization
   - XSS protection
   - Data encryption

## 7. Documentation

1. Code Documentation:

   - JSDoc comments
   - Type definitions
   - Component documentation
   - API documentation

2. Project Documentation:
   - Setup instructions
   - Architecture overview
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment process

## 8. Performance Optimization

1. Bundle Size:

   - Code splitting
   - Tree shaking
   - Asset optimization
   - Dependency analysis

2. Runtime Performance:
   - Memoization
   - Virtualization
   - Image optimization
   - Network optimization

## Implementation Priority

1. High Priority:

   - React Native upgrade
   - State management implementation
   - Basic testing coverage
   - Security improvements

2. Medium Priority:

   - Feature enhancements
