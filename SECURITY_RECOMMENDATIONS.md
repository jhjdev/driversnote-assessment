# Security Recommendations for Environment Variables

## Recent Security Issue
A MongoDB Atlas Database URI with credentials was accidentally committed to the repository in the `rn080-bare/.env` file. This has been addressed by:

1. Removing the sensitive credentials from the repository
2. Creating a template `.env.example` file
3. Updating the `.gitignore` file to prevent future commits of `.env` files

## Required Actions

### 1. Rotate MongoDB Credentials Immediately
The exposed MongoDB credentials (`jhj:P6EjKpqCpBTv0K09`) should be considered compromised. Please:

- Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account
- Change the password for the user 'jhj'
- Update your local .env file with the new credentials
- Verify database connectivity with the new credentials

### 2. Best Practices for Environment Variables

#### For Developers:
- Never commit `.env` files or any files containing secrets to version control
- Use `.env.example` files as templates with placeholder values
- Document required environment variables in README files without including actual values
- Consider using a secrets management solution for team environments

#### For CI/CD:
- Store sensitive information in CI/CD environment variables or secure vaults
- Use environment-specific configuration for different deployment stages
- Implement secret rotation policies

#### For Code Review:
- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information
- Use automated scanning tools to detect potential secret leaks

## Additional Security Measures

### Git History Cleanup (Optional)
If you need to completely remove the sensitive information from Git history, consider:

```bash
# WARNING: This rewrites Git history and requires force-pushing
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch rn080-bare/.env" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

Note that this is a destructive operation and should be coordinated with all team members.

### Monitoring
Consider setting up monitoring for your MongoDB Atlas instance to detect any unusual access patterns that might indicate unauthorized access.
