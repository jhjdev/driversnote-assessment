# Migration Report: React Native 0.80 with Redux Toolkit Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of our React Native application to version 0.80 with Expo bare workflow, including a complete overhaul of the state management system from React Context to Redux Toolkit. The migration followed the incremental approach outlined in the `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, with additional focus on modernizing the state management architecture.

  - Replaced the `UserContext` with a fully-typed Redux store
  - Implemented slice-based state management with `createSlice`
  - Added memoized selectors for efficient state access

- ✅ **Implemented RTK Query for API calls**
  - Created a dedicated API slice for data fetching
  - Added automatic caching and request deduplication
  - Implemented proper loading and error states

### Screen Migrations

  - Add image optimization for better performance
  - Use virtualized lists for large datasets

## Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ Removed deprecated React Context implementation
- ✅ Eliminated prop drilling through proper state management
- ✅ Replaced ad-hoc data fetching with a structured approach
- ✅ Improved type safety throughout the application

## Conclusion

The migration to React Native 0.80 with Redux Toolkit has been successfully completed. The application now has a more robust, maintainable, and scalable architecture. The use of modern tools like Redux Toolkit and RTK Query has significantly improved the developer experience and application performance.

The codebase is now better positioned for future enhancements and features, with a solid foundation that follows current best practices in React Native development.
